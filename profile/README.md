Our AI based algorithm 'MoonScore' will help you decide which trades you should take and which you should avoid.
Copy only the trades you like

Unlike other social trading platforms, you get to choose the trades you'd like to trade.
Until today, people were splitted between many different platforms and websites, to collect all the relevant information they needed for their trading, but not any more.
With MoonWiz, you‚Äôll find all the information you need in one place, with additional features that will help you & improve your trading.

Each user gets a ranking based on his posts & signals performance, and that in order to help other users to understand who they should trade with, and also for the user himself.

MoonWiz‚Äôs team isn‚Äôt just a team of developers and graphic designers, MoonWiz is built for traders, by traders, so we as a team know exactly what you need to become a better trader.

And that applies to all of the features that we have on our platform, starts from the posting system that made for posting charts, ideas & Funny GIFs as traders love to do, to our $CashTag system that bolding the currency from the other content in the post, our AI ranking system that rate each user based on his posts & signals performance, and that in order to help other users to understand who they should trade with. 
And the last feature, the CoinPage, that summarizes all the important information that a trader needs about a coin, in just one page, including the current price, coin rank, newest posts & News, top signals providers and many other useful features.

We are aware that people love to spend their time building their profile on social media, and we know exactly what crypto traders like! 
That‚Äôs why we added some nice features to our user page so each user will be able to edit his profile to his liking, as we know many people these days are buying Nft‚Äôs and using them as their profile pictures on the social media, so each user will be able to add his own profile picture, choose how his name will appear to other users, write a short description (BIO) about himself, and there will be counters that shows how many posts & likes this user have, and his ranking on the platform and his trading success rate.

Our users will receive badges for their engagement on the platform, such as posts, likes & comments and other activities that they do on the platform.

We in MoonWiz, understand the importance of a community, it‚Äôs part of our human nature, and when it comes to trading, we‚Äôre craving to communicate with others about our ideas and thoughts.
We all know the power of a community, and what can be better than a community that supports each other and gives useful information to help each other profit. 

We believe that anyone should be rewarded for the content they‚Äôre providing, based on the love that they received by their audience.
That‚Äôs why we are planning to have a reward system, based on a crypto token that we develop so we‚Äôll be able to reward our users for good content they are posting.

And because of all of that, we came up with the idea of Moonwiz.

## Features
### MoonScore‚Ñ¢
The MoonScore‚Ñ¢ is one of the most effective & useful features that a trader on social media can dream about.
As we already mentioned, The community takes a big part of the reasons why a coin is going up or down, but how can you understand what the community thinks if there are millions of posts every day?

That is why we developed the MoonScore‚Ñ¢, an AI based score system, that brings the Social Intelleniant to the next level, and more important for that, brings it to the front of the users.

Our AI takes all the posts that were posted on our platform, analyze them by many segments.
After we consulted with dozens of professional traders & Community managers from the crypto industry, we understand how people express their thoughts on each coin (e.g when someone posts: ‚Äú$BTC to the moon!‚Äù this is a very bullish post).

### Artificial Intelligence
We hand-trained our AI to understand all types of posts & Crypto slogans, and give each one of them an inside score that will be calculated by the algorithm.
By the end, the user will see the MoonScore‚Ñ¢ for each coin and this in order to show them with simple numbers the sentiment situation in the market about a specific coin.
This included Social volume, social sentiment dominance of the coin compared to the whole market, social engagement and 6 more factors that will be calculated.

### Coin Page
In-App CoinPage - We understand the need of our users to be able to see relevant information about each coin, such as: Current price, market cap, most popular posts about it and top rated traders for this currency. We want to make our users‚Äô lives easier, so we summarize all the information that the trader needs into our MoonWiz ecosystem, so the user doesn't need to go around and open new websites and platforms to find the information he needs.
Cashtag - We all remember the power of Hashtags when instagram just came out, for traders, $Cashtag is one of the most useful tools they can use on a social media platform for easy navigation and searching.
Reward-Based social media platform - We believe in rewarding good content creators, that's why we thought about the idea of $MOON, an ERC-20 based token that we made, that will be given to users based on the love they received by the community.
The users will get rewards for each like/comment that they get on their posts.

### Trader-Friendly Features (Bullish & Bearish)
We know that crypto users are very likely to associate themselves to a Bullish or a Bearish trends, that‚Äôs why we added 2 buttons for each post (Beside the Like Comment & Share), that users can vote for Bullish/Bearish and join the trend, and that‚Äôs also in order to help our AI system to understand the market sentiment situation better.
Private Rooms Channels- Inside any community, there are small groups that are built around specific titles, people or interests. That‚Äôs why we also offer private groups inside our platform, that influencers, course owners or signal providers will be able to create and develop for themselves a small community of their own.
Most updated news & information - As traders, we need to be updated with the latest news about the market, because any positive or negative announcement, can skyrocket or make a big drop on a coin in seconds.
That‚Äôs why we provide our users with real-time updates about the most recent information and the latest news & announcements in the market.
Advanced Notification system - As part of our commitment to provide the users the latest updates, and keep them with real-time alerts, we developed an Advanced Notification System that helps the users to know when something is happening without them being worried about missing an important news.

Open & Supported community - MoonWiz is a place where anyone can post & discuss anything that is on his mind. 
Being part of the MoonWiz community will help our users to have more confidence before entering a trade, Get all the information that they need to make a calculated decision, and verify their information with multiple sources of knowledge.

TradingView & Crypto Exchanges API Integration - In the future, we plan to have integration with the top exchanges, so people will be able to post their charts & analysis directly from TradingView, and be able to share their trades & profits on MoonWiz from their Exchanges.
This feature is made for 2 reasons, the first one is to help our users get a better workflow and user experience, and second, is to help users verify their content (By posting profits or trades directly from your exchange, we can verify to other users that this information is real.
